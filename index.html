        <p class="intro">
            <p>Hi, I am a data enthusiast with a love for turning raw numbers into meaningful insights. With a Master's in Analytics from UC Berkeley, 
            I've developed strong skills in machine learning, deep learning, data modeling, and optimization. 
            My experience includes applying predictive analytics and decision science to real-world problems, for instance, in evaluating business and location strategies. 
            I also have a keen interest in supply chain analysis, exploring how data-driven approaches can improve efficiency and strategic planning.</p>
            <p>Before joining Cal, I studied Mathematics and Economics at NYU, where I gained a strong foundation in analytical thinking and financial principles.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, I have a passion for soccer and basketball—not just as a player but also from an analytical perspective. 
            I enjoy examining the business side of sports, from player valuations to revenue trends in merchandise and sponsorship deals.
        </p>
